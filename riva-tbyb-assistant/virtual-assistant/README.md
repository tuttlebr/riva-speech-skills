# Riva Virtual Assistant Example

## Overview

The Virtual Assistant sample demonstrates how to use Riva AI Services, specifically ASR, NLP, and TTS, to build a simple but complete conversational AI application. It demonstrates receiving input via speech from the user, interpreting the query via an intention recognition and slot filling approach, computing a response, and speaking this back to the user in a natural voice.
